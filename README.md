🛒 Online Grocery Order Management System
Online Grocery Order Management System is a web-based application built using Java and Spring Boot to streamline the process of managing grocery orders. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, this application enables customers to browse products, create orders, and manage their shopping processes while allowing administrators to efficiently process orders. The application uses file-based storage instead of a database and incorporates data structures like Queues and sorting algorithms like Merge Sort to handle customer orders and product listings effectively.

📝 Features
Customer Functionalities:
Browse Product Catalog: Search and view groceries by category.

Add to Cart: Create a shopping cart with the ability to update quantities or remove items.

Checkout: Place orders and track order status after checkout.

Admin Functionalities:
Order Management: Process customer orders sequentially using a Queue data structure.

Product Management: Add, update, and delete product information.

Sorting Products: Sort groceries dynamically by category or price using Merge Sort.

General:
User-Friendly Interface: Built with responsive design using HTML, CSS (Tailwind/Bootstrap), and JavaScript.

File-based Persistence: Implements CSV file I/O for data storage, eliminating the need for a database.

Data Structures and Algorithms: Efficient order queue management and product sorting.

🌟 Key Concepts and Technologies
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implements encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Data Structures: Uses a custom Queue to handle order processing.

Algorithm: Implements Merge Sort for sorting products by price or category.

File Handling: Reads and writes to CSV files for persistence.

Java Web Technologies: Developed with Spring Boot.

UI Design: Interactive and responsive UIs created with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

🚀 How It Works
Product Management: Manage products (CRUD operations) via file-based persistence.

Shopping Cart and Checkout: Customers can add items to their cart, view cart details, and confirm the order.

Order Processing: Admin processes orders sequentially through a queue.

Sorting: Products are sorted dynamically by price or category using Merge Sort.

📊 Future Enhancements
Add user authentication and role-based access (e.g., customer vs. admin).

Implement advanced reporting for product sales and trends.

Improve file structure for scalability.

Support additional file formats (e.g., JSON or XML).
